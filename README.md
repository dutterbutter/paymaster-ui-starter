# Paymaster UI Starter Template 

This is a frontend application for the Greeter contract, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on the zkSync Testnet.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, first clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:dutterbutter/paymaster-ui-starter.git
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```
cd paymaster-ui-starter && yarn install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the Next.js server on `localhost:3000`.

## Updating the Greeting

To change the greeting message, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser. Make sure you have MetaMask set up for the zkSync Testnet.

If you possess the applicable NFT then the transaction fees will be covered by the paymaster.

Enter a new greeting message and submit it by clicking the "Change greeting" button.

Note that the application is currently only deployed on the zkSync Testnet, so you will need to have an account on that network and some testnet funds to use it.
